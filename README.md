# Face Recognition Attendance System

A Python-based attendance system leveraging real-time face recognition with dlib and OpenCV, featuring a Tkinter GUI for face registration and a Flask web interface for attendance lookup.

---

## Features

- **Face Registration:** Register new users via webcam using a Tkinter GUI. Images are stored in `data/data_faces_from_camera/`.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extracts 128D facial features using dlib's ResNet model and stores them in `data/features_all.csv`.
- **Real-Time Recognition & Attendance:** Recognizes faces from webcam input, marks attendance in an SQLite database (`attendance.db`), and prevents duplicate entries per day.
- **Web Interface:** Flask app to view attendance records by date, rendered with Bootstrap for a clean UI.

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd Attendance
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download dlib models:**  
   Place `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` and `dlib_face_recognition_resnet_model_v1.dat` in `data/data_dlib/`.  
   (These files are large and must be downloaded separately from the official dlib model zoo.)

## Usage

### 1. Register Faces

Run the Tkinter GUI to register new users:
```bash
python get_faces_from_camera_tkinter.py
```
- Enter a name, capture face images, and save. Images are stored in `data/data_faces_from_camera/`.

### 2. Extract Features

After registering faces, extract features:
```bash
python features_extraction_to_csv.py
```
- This generates/updates `data/features_all.csv`.

### 3. Start Attendance Recognition

Run the real-time recognition and attendance marking:
```bash
python attendance_taker.py
```
- Recognized faces are marked present in `attendance.db` with timestamp and date.

### 4. View Attendance

Start the Flask web server:
```bash
python app.py
```
- Visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to select a date and view attendance records.

## Technical Details

- **Face Detection & Recognition:**  
  Uses dlib's HOG-based detector and ResNet-based 128D face embeddings. Recognition is performed by comparing embeddings with a Euclidean distance threshold.
- **Database:**  
  Attendance is stored in SQLite (`attendance.db`), with uniqueness enforced per user per day.
- **Web UI:**  
  Flask serves a Bootstrap-styled HTML page for querying attendance by date.

## Notes

- **Do NOT commit:**  
  - `venv/`, `attendance.db`, `data/data_dlib/`, `data/data_faces_from_camera/`, `data/features_all.csv`
- **Model files** must be downloaded separately due to size and licensing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- dlib, numpy, scikit-image, pandas, opencv-python, flask
